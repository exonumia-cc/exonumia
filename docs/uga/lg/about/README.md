## Why does the Exonumia Project exist?

**Africa** is home to over a billion people who speak a diverse set of languages. Some estimates claim there being over 3000 dialects spoken by the many ethnicities of the continent. Regardless of its rich history, a majority of the countries are still rural/developing countries. Almost all of Africa was colonized by Europe during the late 19th century (with only Ethiopia and Liberia maintaining their independence). The current lack of prosperity can partly be pinned on the constant state of war and the many independence and decolonization struggles being dealt with in post colonial Africa.

One of the many side effects that the era of colonization has had on Africans is that changes to how most countries are run were/are made effectively without the consultation or participation of the majority of the population. Many countries have legal and economic systems that use a language which is foreign to the natives of the country.

To highlight the impact that this switch in languages has had we would like to reference an extract from the book [Theory and History](https://mises.org/library/theory-and-history-interpretation-social-and-economic-evolution#page=246) by the Austrian economist Ludwig von Mises. In the section [Undoing History](https://cdn.mises.org/Theory%20and%20History%20An%20Interpretation%20of%20Social%20and%20Economic%20Evolution_1.pdf#page=246) Mises highlights how those only fluent in the native languages are relagated to subordinate positions of society when new rulers come to power and enforce a new language as the medium of instruction for both economic and political activities. The longer such a society continues to conduct day to day affairs without using their native dialects then those native dialects die out because they become insufficient tools for those looking to part take in activities of value. He delivers this point as follows

> A  language  is  not  simply  a  collection  of   phonetic signs.  It is  an instrument  of  thinking  and  acting.  Its vocabulary  and  grammar  are  adjusted  to  the  mentality  of the  individuals  whom  it  serves.  A  living  language-spoken,  written,  and  read by  living  men—changes  continually  in  conformity  with  changes  occurring  in  the minds  of  those who use it. A language fallen  into desuetude  is  dead  because  it  no  longer  changes.  It  mirrors the  mentality  of  people  long  since  passed  away.  It  is useless  to  the  people  of  another  age  no  matter  whether these  people  are  biologically  the  scions  of  those  who once  used  it  or  merely  believe  themselves  to  be  their descendants. - [Ludwig von Mises](https://cdn.mises.org/Theory%20and%20History%20An%20Interpretation%20of%20Social%20and%20Economic%20Evolution_1.pdf#page=251)

The chapter uses Ireland as example state where an natives language got replaced by the language spoken by the new rulers. Ludwig von Mises then spends a good portion of the chapter discussing the difficulties in undoing the damage caused by the replacement/killing of the old native language(s).

> Those  who  want  to  revive  a  dead  language  must  in fact  create  out  of  its phonetic  elements  a new  language whose  vocabulary  and  syntax  are  adjusted  to  the  conditions  of  the  present  age,  entirely  different  from  those of  the  old  age.  The  tongue  of  their  ancestors  is  of  no use  to  the  modern  Irish.  The  laws  of  present-day  Ireland could  not  be  written  in the  old  vocabulary;  Shaw,Joyce,  and  Yeats  could  not  have  employed  it  in  their plays,  novels,  and  poems.  One  cannot  wipe  out  history and return to the past.

The **Exonumia** project understands the difficulties faced by native speakers of languages which have been excluded from the economic and political activities in the African continent. To avoid the native African being excluded from the activities and developments which are possible through using Bitcoin as a medium for economic activity we wish to translate as much content as we can and get it to the people who would benefit the most from it.
<!-- From a country picking up the gold standard. To a countries currency getting hyperinflated as a result of the many ways in which those in power can manipulate the fait standard. The African population has been delagated to play the rule of victim in majority of these transitions. -->



## Why the name Exonumia?

The wikipedia entry for Exonumia states that

> Exonumia are numismatic items (such as tokens, medals, or scrip) other than coins and paper money. This includes "Good For" tokens, badges, counterstamped coins, elongated coins, encased coins, souvenir medallions, tags, wooden nickels and other similar items. It is related to numismatics (concerned with coins which have been legal tender), and many coin collectors are also exonumists. 

And the definition of Numismatics is *the study or collection of coins, tokens, and paper money and sometimes related objects (such as medals).*

Since the purpose for this platform is to translate content that explains how Bitcoin works into native African language we thought it fitting to use the word Exonumia as the name of the project.
